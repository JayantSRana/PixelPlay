## Software Requirements

### Arduino IDE Setup
1. Install ESP32 board package
2. Install required libraries:
   - Adafruit GFX Library
   - Adafruit SSD1306
   - Adafruit NeoPixel

### Library Installation
```
Tools â†’ Manage Libraries â†’ Search and install:
- Adafruit GFX Library by Adafruit
- Adafruit SSD1306 by Adafruit  
- Adafruit NeoPixel by Adafruit
```

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `retro_gaming_console.ino` in Arduino IDE
3. Select your ESP32 board and port
4. Upload the code to your ESP32

## Usage

### Controls
- **Joystick 1 (Player 1)**: Menu navigation and game control
- **Joystick 2 (Player 2)**: Second player control (game dependent)
- **Pause Button (GPIO 13)**: Pause/resume current game
- **Reset Button (GPIO 4)**: Reset score and game state

### Navigation
1. **Splash Screen**: Press Joy1 button to continue
2. **Game Menu**: Use Joy1 Y-axis to navigate, Joy1 button to select
3. **In Game**: Use joysticks for gameplay, pause/reset buttons for control

### Game Features
- Real-time score display
- High score tracking (saved to EEPROM)
- Visual feedback via NeoPixel animations
- Audio feedback via buzzer
- Pause/resume functionality

## Customization

### Adding New Games
1. Add game name to `games[]` array
2. Update `GAME_COUNT` constant
3. Implement game logic in `gameLoopStep()` function
4. Add game-specific input handling

### Modifying Visual Effects
- Edit `rainbowAnimation()` for startup effects
- Modify `pixelsFill()` calls for different color schemes
- Adjust LED brightness in `setup()` with `pixels.setBrightness()`

### Sound Customization
- Modify frequencies and durations in `toneBeep()` calls
- Add new sound effects by calling `toneBeep(frequency, duration)`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Compilation Errors with LEDC functions:**
- The code includes compatibility for multiple ESP32 core versions
- If errors persist, update ESP32 board package to latest version

**OLED Not Working:**
- Check I2C connections (SDA/SCL)
- Verify OLED address (usually 0x3C)
- Ensure adequate power supply

**Joystick Issues:**
- Check ADC pin assignments
- Calibrate center values (around 2048 for 12-bit ADC)
- Avoid using ADC2 pins when WiFi is active

**NeoPixel Not Lighting:**
- Verify data pin connection
- Check power requirements (5V for WS2812B)
- Ensure proper ground connections

## Technical Specifications

- **Frame Rate**: ~30 FPS (33ms frame time)
- **Display**: 128x64 monochrome OLED
- **LEDs**: 16 individually addressable RGB
- **Audio**: PWM-generated tones via buzzer
- **Storage**: EEPROM for persistent high scores
- **Input**: Analog joysticks + digital buttons

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Implement actual game logic for Pong, Snake, Breakout, Tetris
- [ ] Add multiplayer support
- [ ] Implement game saves
- [ ] Add more sound effects and music
- [ ] Create custom graphics and sprites
- [ ] Add WiFi connectivity for online features
- [ ] Implement game difficulty levels
